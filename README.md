# DES-Encrypt-Decrypt-with-GUI

## Overview
In this Project a DES Encrytion/Decryption Python GUI application is implemented using Python Tkinter.
This application converts inputs file [input.txt]() to DES Encrypted data and saves the Encrypted file as [output.txt]().
Also the Encrypted file can be Decrypted using the same GUI by providing Encrypted File and Encrytion key.
Decrypted Files Output is saved as [DEoutput.txt]().

##Inputs
- Filename = example.txt
- Key = 12345678

## Note
- Use utf-8 encoded txt files only.
- Key must be 8 characters long.
- If the file isnt is the same directory provide your file path.
